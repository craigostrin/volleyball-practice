controls:
all on one hand is awkward
F right next to D

deflating to know he was gonna hit the ball too far away to reach it
would be cool to dive (CO: maybe a dash + hit? so its Big Skill)

getting into a rhythm, messing it up, having to recover was really fun

crouch felt slow, didnt get to the point where he thought to use it

RICH 

would use crouch to hit the ball up high

manual button to make the ball drop
