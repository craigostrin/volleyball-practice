REDDIT:

make arrow keys also default movement
try S for crouch
make an easy mode with a dash or sprint (limited use, stamina)

mayyyybe play around with arm strength - "instead of space just pushing the arm upwards, more like the real game so you hold it to accumulate energy and you release that energy"
 - the longer you hold it, the faster the swing?
 - holding it makes you stand still?

play around with physics, ball should bounce more, gravity should be higher
 - "speeding up the game would make it more addicting"
 - bounce off the floor doesn't matter as much (maybe cuz it's grass)
platform should reset faster
* character should reset when ball resets

add a ball spawn on the right side



RICHARD
controls:
all on one hand is awkward
F right next to D

deflating to know he was gonna hit the ball too far away to reach it
would be cool to dive (CO: maybe a dash + hit? so its Big Skill)

getting into a rhythm, messing it up, having to recover was really fun

crouch felt slow, didnt get to the point where he thought to use it

RICH 

would use crouch to hit the ball up high

manual button to make the ball drop
