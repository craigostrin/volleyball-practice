This game isn't Finishedâ„¢, but it *is* finished. I've achieved everything I set out to do, and I don't really feel any need to continue working on it.

For instance, it still has a welcome mat for playtesters on the main menu, but... who cares? :)

### Contributing
There's a bunch of great feedback from playtesters in `./feedback.txt`. One day maybe I'll implement it. If you'd like to do so, go ahead!
